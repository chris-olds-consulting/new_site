- 👋 Hi, I’m Old and no longer employable. And most certainly crazy-as-fuck
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud Architecture, I love computers and electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several new areas, as I've been shoved out of the workforce.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on certain projects.  But, I'm likely to go sit in a coffee shop somewhere so all you folks that actually know what the fuck you're doing can take over
- 📫 How to reach me chris.olds@marscitymedia.co  yeah,  I've never once_had_anyone_reach_out to hire me for anything since about 2006.
